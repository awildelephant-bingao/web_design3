                <p>Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. Three species
                    are
                    currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian
                    elephant.
                    Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the.

                <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found
                    in
                    different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and
                    they
                    stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their
                    impact
                    on their environments. Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come
                    together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female
                    with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not include bulls,
                    are
                    led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the matriarch.

            <p style="display: none">African elephants are listed as vulnerable and Asian elephants as endangered by the
                International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant
                populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild
                elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working
                animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on
                display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have
                been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.</p>
