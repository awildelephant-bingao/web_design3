                <p>Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. Three species are
                    currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
                    Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the
                    mastodons.

                <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in
                    different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they
                    stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact
                    on their environments. Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come
                    together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female
                    with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not include bulls, are
                    led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the matriarch.
